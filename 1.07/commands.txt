for some myst40erious reason i don't get this working

curl -v http://localhost:8082
curl: (52) Empty reply from server

Every time

Although
kubectl port-forward hashgenerator-web-dep-6f4f8d67fd-mnxw2 3003:3000

works normally.

curl -I  http://localhost:8081
HTTP/1.1 502 Bad Gateway
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Date: Thu, 06 May 2021 19:41:53 GMT
Content-Length: 11
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

Obviously it cannot contact the backend web server
